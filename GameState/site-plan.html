			<p>Main Image: <img src="images/Minecraft/Minecraft.webp" alt="Minecraft Box Art" class="content-img"></p>
			<p>Rating: 5/5</p>
			<p>Description: Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work of art – the choice is all yours. But if the thought of exploring a vast new world all on your own feels overwhelming, then fear not! Let’s explore what Minecraft is all about!</p>
			<p>Tags: Sandbox, Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Survival</p>
			<p>Release Date: November 2011</p>
			<p>Review: Minecraft is a fun sandbox game. Over time, you learn that the main limit to the game is your own imagination. With three dimensions to work with, you can build amazing things and work together on builds with friends. A game best played with others. In addition, Minecraft is easily moddable, allowing for new and unique experiences with mods. My personal favorite is the Create mod, creating large scale factories in the game. Overall, one of my favorite games.</p>

			<p>Game Title: Terraria</p>
			<p>Main Image: <img src="images/Terraria/Terraria.webp" alt="Terraria Box Art" class="content-img"></p>
			<p>Rating: 5/5</p>
			<p>Description: Dig, Fight, Explore, Build: The very world is at your fingertips as you fight for survival, fortune, and glory. Will you delve deep into cavernous expanses in search of treasure and raw materials with which to craft ever-evolving gear, machinery, and aesthetics? Perhaps you will choose instead to seek out ever-greater foes to test your mettle in combat? Maybe you will decide to construct your own city to house the host of mysterious allies you may encounter along your travels? In the World of Terraria, the choice is yours! Blending elements of classic action games with the freedom of sandbox-style creativity, Terraria is a unique gaming experience where both the journey and the destination are completely in the player’s control. The Terraria adventure is truly as unique as the players themselves! Are you up for the monumental task of exploring, creating, and defending a world of your own?</p>
			<p>Tags: Survival, Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Sandbox, 2D</p>
			<p>Release Date: May 2011</p>
			<p>Review: Terraria is a lot like Minecraft to me. Lots of creativity and fun adventures. The main difference is that Terraria is more combat based. It has a lot more weapons and items that you can take between your worlds. You upgrade your character and fight amazingly designed bosses. Combat is unique and different depending on what you do. Compared to Minecraft, you need the Terraria Wiki opened up as you play. The world is quite expansive for a 2d environment, and it’s honestly up on the list of my favorite games.</p>

			<p>Game Title: Stardew Valley</p>
			<p>Main Image:  <img src="images/Stardew Valley/Stardew Valley.webp" alt="Stardew Valley Box Art" class="content-img"></p>
			<p>Rating: 3/5</p>
			<p>Description: Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness! </p>
			<p>Tags: Singleplayer, Multiplayer, Sandbox, RPG, Life Sim</p>
			<p>Release Date: February 2016</p>
			<p>Review: Stardew Valley is a slow moving farming simulator. It’s pretty amazing as a game. Lots of items, relationships with different NPC characters, and even the ability to play multiplayer. While I do find the game fun, it is a very slow and monotonous game at some points. Things take time, sometimes years in game to complete. Balancing relationships and keeping track of NPC schedules can get annoying. Overall, an amazing game, but not really in my main interest.</p>

			<p>Game Title: Mario & Luigi: Brothership</p>
			<p>Main Image: <img src="images/Mario and Luigi Brothership/Mario and Luigi Brothership.webp" alt="Mario & Luigi: Brothership Box Art" class="content-img"></p>
			<p>Rating:  4/5</p>
			<p>Description: Mario & Luigi: Brothership is a 2024 role-playing video game developed by Acquire and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the sixth main installment in the Mario & Luigi series, following Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, and is the first Mario & Luigi game for a home console.</p>
			<p>Tags: Singleplayer, RPG, Action</p>
			<p>Release Date: November 2024</p>
			<p>Review: I was very much excited when this game was announced. I loved the previous Mario & Luigi release, Dream Team. And now I had a chance to play the newest installment in a series long thought dead. The original titles were made by AlphaDream. Now Nintendo has brought back the series. It was very fun to play, the soundtrack was amazing, with the gameplay being intuitive. I did have to mark it down for being a bit too Luigi apologetic. In the past, Luigi was not kindly looked on by the game’s characters. This time around they praised him so much it was a bit too much. Still fun though. I also wish there was more boss fights that were unique. Overall though, I loved the humor and characters added. Having the gameplay being based around forming connections was also very sweet. A very wholesome game.</p>

			<p>Main Image: <img src="images/Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy/Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy.webp" alt="Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy Box Art" class="content-img"></p>
			<p>Rating: 5/5</p>
			<p>Description: The classic courtroom adventure series that has sold over 6.7 million copies worldwide is finally here. Become Phoenix Wright and experience the thrill of battle as you fight to save your innocent clients in a court of law.

			<p>Tags: Visual Novel, Mystery, Puzzle, Singleplayer</p>
			<p>Release Date: April 2019</p>
			<p>Review: This game is a classic with amazing music. As you delve into the cases of Phoenix Wright, you get wrapped up in the music. Every character, scene, moment in the courtroom you get music that is tailored to it. You go through the evidence and find contradictions with witness testimony. You object and fight your way through the courtroom to find the truth. Each of the characters are memorable, with unique punny names and stories that really make you invested in the world. This is three games worth of content, and each final case is more amazing than the last.</p>
